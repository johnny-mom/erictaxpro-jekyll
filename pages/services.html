                            <h3>Why us?</h3>
                            <p>Community Income Tax Service specializes in all aspects of 
                                bookkeeping and tax preparation. As IRS Designated Tax Preparers (RTRP/AFSP), 
                                (and authorized E-File providers), we feel that it is our duty to provide excellent, affordable, 
                                and most importantly convenient services to our clients. We have been preparing taxes for the 
                                community for over twenty years now and as a result it is not surprising that we have such 
                                a large and diversified group of clients (over 300 clients of all different ethnic backgrounds).</p>
                            <p>All of our RTRP/AFSP’s follow a strict rule which is to always keep up with both federal & 
                                state tax laws and to continually enroll in advanced tax preparation courses to refine 
                                their skills and fulfill continuing education requirements. Our clients inspire us to go 
                                above and beyond to maximize the amount of monetary compensation our clients receive from the IRS. 
                                Also, as licensed realtors we can satisfy all of your real estate needs and demands.</p>
